This Repo is to showcase my progress as I go through the You Don't Know JS book while I solve the practice questions at the end of each chapter and then push it up to git.

I shall also be adding the practice questions to my repo so anyone who may just want to try their hands out at the questions can do so without having to read the book.

	The first book in the YDKJS series 'Up & Going' is supposed to have its own directory and then contain all the code snippets and practice codes in them, however it looks like the the codes in Anschapter1 and Questionch1 will sit outside that directory until I can understand how the git workflow works then I will shift them into their directory.

	Also, there was no practice question at the end of Chapter 2 which was mostly dedicated to ensuring that the readers grasps some basic JS concepts.
